# üß∞ RapidChangeATC Plugin for ncSender

The **RapidChangeATC** plugin brings automatic tool-change support and tool management directly into **ncSender**.
It dynamically generates tool-change macros on-the-fly and enhances the G-Code Visualizer with a **Tools List**, allowing you to easily manage and swap tools during a job.
